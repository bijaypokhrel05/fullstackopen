## Backend Summary

Every time we have to initialize *server* package using `npm init -y` before working on **backend**. A **backend server** is the part of an application that runs on the *server* (not in your browser).

#### HTTP
- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol that ***browsers and servers use to communicate with each other***.
- When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the server.
- The server **responds** with an HTTP response (like HTML, JSON, images, etc.).

#### Express
- **Express.js** is a framework built on top of Node.js’s built-in ***http module***.
- ***It makes building backend servers easier and faster***.
- Without Express, you’d have to manually handle ***routing, request parsing, middleware***, etc. with raw http — which is tedious.
